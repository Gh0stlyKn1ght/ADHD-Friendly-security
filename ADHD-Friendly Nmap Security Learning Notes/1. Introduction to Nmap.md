# **🔎 Introduction to Nmap**

**What is Nmap?**  
Nmap (Network Mapper) is an **open-source network scanning** tool written in **C, C++, Python, and Lua**. It helps:  
✅ Identify available hosts on a network  
✅ Discover services, applications, and versions  
✅ Detect operating systems  
✅ Check firewalls, packet filters, and IDS configurations

---

# **🛠️ Use Cases of Nmap**

Nmap is widely used by **network administrators** and **security specialists** for:  
✔️ **Security auditing** of networks  
✔️ **Penetration testing simulations**  
✔️ **Firewall & IDS analysis**  
✔️ **Network mapping**  
✔️ **Response analysis**  
✔️ **Identifying open ports**  
✔️ **Vulnerability assessments**

# **⚙️ Nmap Architecture**

Nmap provides different **scanning techniques** based on your needs:  
1️⃣ **Host Discovery** – Finds active devices on a network  
2️⃣ **Port Scanning** – Identifies open and closed ports  
3️⃣ **Service Enumeration** – Detects services & versions  
4️⃣ **OS Detection** – Determines operating system types  
5️⃣ **Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)** – Runs custom scripts on targets

---

# **📌 Nmap Syntax**

💻 The basic syntax for Nmap is:

```bash
nmap <scan types> <options> <target>
```

Example:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS localhost
```

# **🚀 Scan Techniques**

Nmap supports multiple **scanning techniques** for different scenarios. You can view them using:

```bash
nmap --help
```

🔹 **Common Scan Types:**

- **-sS** – TCP SYN Scan _(fast and stealthy)_
- **-sT** – TCP Connect Scan _(full connection scan)_
- **-sU** – UDP Scan _(for UDP ports)_
- **-sN/sF/sX** – Null, FIN, Xmas scans _(firewall evasion techniques)_
- **-sO** – IP Protocol Scan _(detects active protocols)_
- **--scanflags** – Custom TCP flag scans

# **🔍 Understanding the TCP-SYN Scan (-sS)**

The **TCP-SYN scan** is a **default and highly efficient scan** because:  
✔️ It scans **thousands of ports per second** 🚀  
✔️ It **does not** complete the three-way handshake, keeping it stealthy 🕵️‍♂️

💡 **How Nmap Interprets Responses:**

- **SYN-ACK response** → **Port is OPEN** ✅
- **RST response** → **Port is CLOSED** ❌
- **No response** → **Port is FILTERED** (possible firewall blocking) 🔥

Example of a TCP-SYN scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS localhost
```

🔹 **Example Output:**

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE  
22/tcp   open  ssh  
80/tcp   open  http  
5432/tcp open  postgresql  
5901/tcp open  vnc-1  
```

📌 **Key Takeaways:**

- The **first column** shows the **port number**.
- The **second column** shows the **port state** (open, closed, filtered).
- The **third column** shows the **service running on the port**.

#### **3️⃣ Find the Highest Port Number**

To determine the **highest open TCP port**, run:

```bash
cat full_scan.nmap | grep "open" | awk '{print $1}' | cut -d '/' -f1 | sort -n | tail -1
```

📌 **Explanation:**

- `grep "open"` → Filters **only open ports**
- `awk '{print $1}'` → Extracts **port numbers**
- `cut -d '/' -f1` → Removes unnecessary text
- `sort -n` → Sorts ports **numerically**
- `tail -1` → Shows the **highest open port**

✅ **Submit the highest port number as the answer.** 🚀

# **🎯 Summary**

✅ **Nmap is a powerful tool** for network scanning and security auditing.  
✅ **Different scan techniques** provide unique ways to gather information.  
✅ **Understanding service responses** is **crucial** for effective scanning.  
✅ **Manual enumeration** is just as important as automated scanning.
