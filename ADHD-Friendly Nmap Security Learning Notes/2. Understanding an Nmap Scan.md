### üõ† **Breakdown & Explanation of the Output**

|**Part**|**Explanation**|
|---|---|
|`Starting Nmap 7.94...`|Shows the Nmap version and the time the scan started.|
|`example.com (192.168.1.10)`|The target's domain name and IP address that were scanned.|
|`Host is up (0.035s latency).`|The target is online and responded in **35 milliseconds**.|
|`Not shown: 996 filtered ports`|Out of **1000 total ports**, only **4 are displayed** because the rest are **filtered** (possibly blocked by a firewall).|
|**PORT** column|Lists the **ports** being scanned.|
|**STATE** column|Indicates if a port is `open`, `closed`, or `filtered`:|
|`22/tcp open ssh`|**Port 22 (SSH)** is **open**, meaning an SSH server is running.|
|`OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.5`|The detected SSH **version**, which can help identify vulnerabilities.|
|`ssh-hostkey`|Shows the SSH **host keys**, which help verify the server's authenticity.|
|`80/tcp open http Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))`|**Port 80 (HTTP)** is **open**, running **Apache 2.4.41** on **Ubuntu**.|
|`http-title: Example Website`|The title of the website hosted on this server.|
|`http-server-header: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)`|The **server's response header**, revealing it‚Äôs running Apache on Ubuntu.|
|`443/tcp open https Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))`|**Port 443 (HTTPS)** is **open**, running the same **Apache version**.|
|`ssl-cert`|Shows SSL certificate details, including **validity period** and **alternative domain names**.|
|`3306/tcp closed mysql`|**Port 3306 (MySQL)** is **closed**, meaning the database service is not accessible.|
|`MAC Address: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E (FakeVendor)`|The **MAC address** of the target, along with a **vendor name** (if detected).|
|`OS detection performed...`|Nmap attempted **OS detection**, but no specific result was displayed.|
|`Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 5.67 seconds`|The scan finished in **5.67 seconds**.|

### üî• **Key Takeaways from This Scan**

- **This machine is running a web server** (Apache on ports 80 & 443).
- **The SSH server is active** and may be exploitable if outdated.
- **The SSL certificate is valid** until **2026**.
- **MySQL is not accessible**, meaning database access may be restricted.
