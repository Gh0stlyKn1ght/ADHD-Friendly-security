# 🏆 **Dictionary Attack with Hashcat** 📖

A **Dictionary Attack** is the simplest but **super effective** way to crack passwords! 💥  
It works by **checking passwords from a wordlist** against the hash you're trying to crack.

✅ **Fast** if the password is common 🚀  
✅ **Great for weak password policies** 🔑  
✅ **Uses real-world password leaks (e.g., rockyou.txt)** 🗂️

## 🔥 **Top 5 Weak Passwords (2020)**

Even with security training, people **still** use these passwords: 😬

```
1️⃣ 123456  
2️⃣ 123456789  
3️⃣ qwerty  
4️⃣ password  
5️⃣ 1234567  
```

🔹 **Good news**: These are all in common wordlists like **rockyou.txt** 🎯

---

## 🛠️ **Installing Wordlists**

🔹 **Get SecLists (tons of wordlists)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git
```

🔹 **Rockyou.txt (found in Kali Linux & Parrot OS)**

```bash
ls /usr/share/wordlists/
```

🔹 **Massive 15GB+ lists** from CrackStation  
(Download from [crackstation.net](https://crackstation.net))

## 🎯 **Basic Dictionary Attack in Hashcat**

🔹 **Syntax:**

```bash
hashcat -a 0 -m <hash type> <hash file> <wordlist>
```

🔹 **Example (SHA-256 Hash)**

```bash
echo -n '!academy' | sha256sum | cut -f1 -d' ' > sha256_hash_example
hashcat -a 0 -m 1400 sha256_hash_example /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

📌 **Breaking this down:**  
✅ `-a 0` → Dictionary attack mode 📖  
✅ `-m 1400` → Hash mode for SHA-256 🔐  
✅ `sha256_hash_example` → The hash file 📂  
✅ `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt` → Wordlist used for cracking 💥

⏳ **Time Taken:** This cracked in **4 seconds!** 🚀

---

## 🔥 **Cracking Slower Hashes (Bcrypt Example)**

Some hashing algorithms (like **Bcrypt**) are **designed to be slow** ⏳.  
🔹 Example Hash:

```bash
$2a$05$ZdEkj8cup/JycBRn2CX.B.nIceCYR8GbPbCCg6RlD7uvuREexEbVy
```

🔹 **Same attack, but takes 1.5+ hours!**

```bash
hashcat -a 0 -m 3200 bcrypt_hash_example /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

📌 **Why so slow?**  
✅ Bcrypt **adds rounds** to make brute force harder 💪  
✅ More rounds = **Exponentially longer cracking time** ⏳

## 🔎 **Advanced Features for Smarter Attacks**

### 📊 **Monitor Cracking Progress in Real-Time**

While cracking, hit **s** to see live stats:

```bash
[s]tatus [p]ause [b]ypass [c]heckpoint [q]uit => s
```

📌 **Shows:**  
✅ Speed (Hashes per second) ⚡  
✅ Progress (%) 📊  
✅ Estimated completion time ⏳  
✅ Current candidate passwords 🔍

---

### 🎯 **Using **Rules** to Mutate Passwords**

🔹 Modify wordlist entries (e.g., add numbers, symbols)

```bash
hashcat -a 0 -m 0 hashes.txt rockyou.txt -r rules/best64.rule
```

📌 **Example Mutations:**  
✅ `password` → `password123!`  
✅ `qwerty` → `Qwerty1`

🔹 **Common rule files:**

```bash
ls /usr/share/hashcat/rules/
```

🔥 **Pro tip:** **Use rules to attack stronger passwords efficiently!** 🚀

---

### 🖥️ **Using GPUs for Faster Cracking**

💡 **Hashcat can use GPUs for insane speed!**  
🔹 **Check available GPUs:**

```bash
hashcat -I
```

🔹 **Use GPU for cracking:**

```bash
hashcat -a 0 -m 1000 hash.txt wordlist.txt --opencl-device-types 1
```

📌 **CPU vs GPU speed comparison (MD5 example)**  
✅ **CPU** → 300 MH/s  
✅ **GPU (RTX 4090)** → **100+ GH/s** 🚀🔥

---

### ⚙️ **Tuning Hashcat for Maximum Performance**

|**Flag**|**What It Does**|**Usage**|
|---|---|---|
|`-O`|Optimized kernels (faster but limits password length)|`hashcat -O ...`|
|`-w 3`|Full-speed mode (max GPU usage)|`hashcat -w 3 ...`|
|`--status`|Show real-time status updates|`hashcat --status ...`|

🔥 **Example (Full-speed brute force with optimizations)**

```bash
hashcat -a 3 -m 1000 hash.txt -O -w 3
```

⚠️ **DO NOT use `--force`** unless you're troubleshooting!

## **Final Thoughts** 🏆

✅ **Dictionary attacks are fast & effective for weak passwords** 🔑  
✅ **Use advanced features** (rules, GPU cracking) to **speed up attacks** 🚀  
✅ **Harder hashes (Bcrypt, Argon2) take much longer to crack** ⏳  
✅ **Tuning Hashcat correctly = Faster cracking!** 🎯

🚀 **Master these skills and you'll dominate password cracking!** 🔓💡
